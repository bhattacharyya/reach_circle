# reach_circle
Simple program to practice reinforcement learning

A simple game designed to understand reinforcement learning using Q-Table

***reach_circle_commandline.py - ***

Extremely fast exploration with fixed starting point but no visuals

***reach_circle_commandline_test.py -***

Visualize the post reinforcement learning performance from above script

***reach_circle_fromanywhere_cl.py - ***

Same as reach_circle_commandline.py but multiple possible starting points

***reach_circle_fromanywhere_test.py -***

Visualize the post reinforcement learning performance from multi startpoint script above

***reach_circle_explore_exploit.py -***

Visualize exploration followed by gradually increasing exploitation 

***Key parameters:***

alpha - learning rate
epsilon - exploration threshold
gamma - discount factor for rewards from events far in time
